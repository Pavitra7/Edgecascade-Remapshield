# Edgecascade-Remapshield

This is a landing repo for the collection of following work.

1. EdgeCaSCADe - a lightweight tool to detect cache side channel attacks. Implemented on Comet RISC V processor : https://github.com/Pavitra7/EdgeCaSCADe.git
2. RemapShield - A hardware software approach to mitigate cache side channel attack. Implemented on Comet RISC V processor : https://github.com/Pavitra7/RemapCache_4KB.git 
3. Use Cases - List of test cases used for both the experiments on EdgeCaSCADe and RemapShield : https://github.com/Pavitra7/Use-Cases.git
4. Synthesis Repo - Holds the synthesis results for area/performance/timing overhead of EdgeCaSCADe and RemapShield with varying parameters : https://gitlab.inria.fr/srokicki/Comet/-/tree/pavitra?ref_type=heads
